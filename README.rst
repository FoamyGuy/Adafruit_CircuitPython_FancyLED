FancyLED is a CircuitPython library to assist in creating buttery smooth LED animation. It's loosely inspired by the FastLED library for Arduino, and in fact we have a "helper" library using similar function names to assist with porting of existing Arduino FastLED projects to CircuitPython.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Usage Example
=============

See the examples in the examples/ folder.
